This repo contains code that was used in analysis that have been published (or are soon to be published) in peer-reviewed journals. While I have made them as accurate as possible, I remain unfortunately human with all of the flaws that come with it. Feel free to let me know (politely) if you find any mistakes. The code is offered 'as is' without any warranties or guarantees of any kind. Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any errors, damages, or issues that arise from the use of this code. 

Code is available under a CC-BY license. This license enables reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long as attribution is given to the creator. The license allows for commercial use. 

While this is my personal repo and therefore all thoughts, opinions, and conclusions are my own, the code found here was prepared by a civilian employee of the US Government as part of my official duties. Therefore, all code is in the public domain and does not possess copyright protection. Public domain information may be freely distributed and copied; however, as a courtesy, it is requested that the authors be given an appropriate acknowledgement.
